# Ingress Configuration Fix for API Gateway

## Issue
The frontend is still experiencing "Endpoint not found" errors when accessing URLs like:
- https://api.elitessystems.com/api/api/auth/google

The problem is a namespace mismatch between the ingress configuration and the deployed gateway service. The auth endpoints are now working correctly when accessed directly with the corrected path structure:
- https://api.elitessystems.com/api/auth/google (returns "Google authentication not configured" - a valid response)

But the original URLs with duplicate `/api` path segments are still failing because the ingress is in a different namespace.

## Changes Made

1. Created a new ingress configuration file `ingress-elitessystems-fix.yaml` with:
   - Changed namespace from `production` to `development` to match where services are deployed
   - This ensures the ingress routes traffic to the correct services

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Apply the updated ingress configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Apply the fixed ingress configuration
   kubectl apply -f k8s-manifests/ingress-elitessystems-fix.yaml
   ```

2. **Verify the ingress is correctly deployed**:
   ```bash
   # Check ingress in development namespace
   kubectl get ingress -n development
   ```

## Frontend Configuration

After fixing the ingress, you'll need to update the frontend code to use the correct API paths:

1. Ensure all API requests use the correct URL structure:
   - Correct: `https://api.elitessystems.com/api/auth/login`
   - Incorrect: `https://api.elitessystems.com/api/api/auth/login`

2. Look for any hardcoded API URLs in the frontend codebase and update them to remove the duplicate `/api` segment.

## Testing

After deployment, test the following endpoints to verify they work correctly:
- https://api.elitessystems.com/api/auth
- https://api.elitessystems.com/api/auth/google
- https://api.elitessystems.com/api/auth/login
- https://api.elitessystems.com/api/auth/register

## Note

This is a temporary fix. The real solution is:
1. Make sure your frontend uses the correct URL structure without duplicate `/api` segments
2. Ensure all services are deployed to the same namespace as the ingress
